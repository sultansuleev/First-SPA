# WeatherApp
My simple project that I created by using API from OpenWeatherMap.\
I created this project when I asked myself how Web Application can be real application as itself. So, first of all I decided to learn how to work with API, so I used as example OpenWeatherMap's API and made this app.  
Just type city's name in the input field and submit it.
